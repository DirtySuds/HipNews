# HipNews WordPress Theme by [Dirty Suds Design](http://dirtysuds.com)

This theme is crazy convoluted, and kind of hacked together. I've been meaning to release parts of it for years, but wanted to wait until everything was perfect, but that is never going to happen.

Take a look at the code and play with it a bit.

I've tried to remove any references to [Dirty Suds](http://dirtysuds.com) or [Hoover High School](http://hooverchallenger.com). Please let me know if you find any that I have neglected to remove.
